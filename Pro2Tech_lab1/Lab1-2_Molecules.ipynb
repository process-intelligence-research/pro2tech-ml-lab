In QSPR, the modeling process can be broken down into two steps: First, QSPR models introduce molecular descriptors $D = [d_1, d_2, ..., d_n]^T$ that depend on the structure of a molecule $m$. Second, a regression model $F(D):D â†’ \\hat{p}$ is fitted that predicts a property $\\hat{p}$ as a function of $D$. The regression model is either linear or nonlinear, depending on the QSPR. QSPR models differ in the way they encode the molecular structure. Various descriptors have been used including structural group counts, the number of aromatic bonds, and topological indices, such as the [Wiener Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_index) or branching indices. Development of QSPR models depends on the choice of informative descriptors, a selection process that requires domain knowledge and intuition. For the sake of time, we skip this process and use predefined descriptors. In our case study, the property $\\hat{p}$ is the normal boiling point and the regression model is of course an ANN!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Opposite to matlab, we do not have all functionalities pre installed in Python.
